        <h2 class="mb-5">Application of Linear Consensus Protocol to Space Debris Deorbiting</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Skills Used</h3>
        <p>Python, Julia, LaTeX</p>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Overview</h3>
        <p>This is a simulation-based project with the goal of commanding autonomous robots that will deorbit
          debris in orbit. For our purposes, we design the control protocol that tells the robots to rendezvous
          with the debris they detect, and we assume the specific deorbiting mechanism is given. This is achieved
          by applying the Linear Consensus Protocol approach to a series of robots and debris, intelligently
          assigning the most optimal debris to each drone, and leaving the debris with no connections so that they move
          in a straight line. This project demonstrates proficiency in programming Python, Julia, LaTeX, and 
          understanding of concepts in controls and multi-agent systems.

          This project focuses on addressing the growing problem of space debris in Earth’s orbit. The solution involves using a Linear Consensus Protocol (LCP) to optimize the process of deorbiting debris, particularly in Medium and High Earth Orbits (MEO and HEO). Unlike traditional methods that target debris clusters, this approach dynamically assigns agents to debris, aiming to minimize fuel consumption while ensuring all detected debris is safely deorbited.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-0">My Contributions</h3>
        <p>Designed the algorithm that detects the available debris, estimates which of the available robots
          will be closer to that debris in the near future, and assigns that robot to that debris.
          Also designed the algorithm to "deorbit" the debris once the robot is within a certain distance of it,
          as well as the function to make the robots and debris move as desired, and plotting.

          •	Orbit Propagation: I developed the code to simulate the orbits of debris and agents in both Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems, laying the foundation for the deorbiting process.
          •	Algorithm Implementation: I implemented and tested the LCP in Cartesian coordinates, which allowed agents to effectively target and deorbit debris. Additionally, I attempted to adapt this protocol to spherical coordinates, though further refinement is needed.
          •	Analysis and Documentation: I analyzed the challenges and findings of the project, documenting the limitations of using LCP for orbital debris and suggesting potential improvements.
        </p>
        <p>This project was first written in Python, and I translated it to Julia for more efficient computing
          as the simulations can get quite slow as the number of objects increase.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Results</h3>
        <p>This is the first step to get to the goal of applying a similar protocol that commands
          optimal orbital maneuvers to complete this task. 

          •	Successfully demonstrated the LCP in Cartesian coordinates, where agents could deorbit debris effectively in a simulated 3D environment.
          •	Identified the limitations of LCP in spherical coordinates, where nonlinear orbital dynamics require a more advanced consensus method.
          •	Proposed future directions for improving the deorbiting algorithm, including exploring nonlinear consensus methods and optimizing trajectories for multiple debris.

        <h2 class="mb-5">Mars Surveyor and Communications Orbiters for Positioning and
          Exploration (SCOPE)</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Overview</h3>
        <p>The SCOPE (Mars Surveyor and Communications Orbiters for Positioning and Exploration) mission was designed to fulfill a dual purpose: scientific exploration and utility services on Mars. The mission is centered around two types of satellites—OPTIMUS and PRIME—which work together to map the mineral composition of Mars and provide vital communication and navigation services for other Mars missions. OPTIMUS focuses on scientific tasks, while PRIME ensures reliable communication relays and global positioning coverage. Together, these satellites meet the mission’s requirements over a planned operational period of at least five years.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-0">My Contributions</h3>
        <li>Communications System Design: I was responsible for the development and implementation of the communications subsystem, ensuring that both the OPTIMUS and PRIME satellites could effectively communicate with Earth. This involved selecting the Deep Space Network (DSN) as our primary ground station for Mars-to-Earth communication. I performed detailed link budget analysis to ensure robust communication links under various conditions, accounting for factors like distance and potential interference.
        </li>
        <li>Communication Hardware: I helped specify the necessary communications hardware, including high-gain antennas for both satellites. For OPTIMUS, I ensured that the Ka-band array was capable of maintaining a reliable connection with the PRIME relay satellites. The communication system was designed to operate efficiently within the mission’s power constraints while ensuring high data transfer rates essential for mission success.
        </li>
        <li>Data Handling Coordination: I worked closely with the Command and Data Handling (C&DH) team to integrate the communications system with the satellite’s onboard computer. This integration ensured that data from the scientific payloads and other subsystems could be transmitted reliably back to Earth.</p>
        </li>
          <h3 class="mb-0">Results</h3>
        <li>Successful Communication Strategy: The communications system I developed allows for consistent data transmission between Mars and Earth, even under challenging conditions such as solar conjunction. The DSN stations in Australia, Spain, and California were leveraged to ensure continuous coverage, maximizing data transfer opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>Robust Link Performance: The link budget analysis confirmed that our communication system could meet or exceed the required signal-to-noise ratios, ensuring clear communication even during critical mission phases. This robustness is vital for both the scientific and navigational aspects of the mission.
        </li>
        <li>Integrated and Efficient System: The communications subsystem was seamlessly integrated with other satellite systems, balancing power usage with performance. This integration contributes to the overall efficiency and reliability of the SCOPE mission, helping to ensure that the mission goals are met within the expected timeline.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Limit Cycles in Predator-Prey Systems</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Overview</h3>
        <p>This project is a literature review focused on the dynamic behavior of predator-prey systems, specifically exploring the existence and stability of limit cycles—a phenomenon where predator and prey populations oscillate in a predictable pattern over time. The review delves into the mathematical underpinnings of these cycles by analyzing seminal works by Robert M. May and Michael E. Gilpin. By studying these systems through the lens of nonlinear differential equations and concepts like Hopf bifurcations, this project seeks to enhance our understanding of how predator-prey populations can coexist in a stable, yet dynamic equilibrium.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-0">My Contributions</h3>
        <li>Mathematical Analysis: I conducted a thorough mathematical analysis of predator-prey models, starting with the linearization of the system at its equilibrium points. This involved calculating eigenvalues to determine the stability of these points and exploring how small perturbations could lead to large-scale population oscillations, known as limit cycles.
        </li>  
        <li>Nondimensionalization: To simplify the complex system and make the analysis more generalizable, I nondimensionalized the equations governing predator-prey interactions. This step reduced the number of parameters and highlighted the key factors influencing system behavior, making it easier to study the effects of various parameters on population dynamics.
        </li>
        <li>Simulation and Visualization: I reproduced the results from the literature through simulations, generating plots that demonstrate how the predator-prey system evolves over time. These visualizations include phase plots that show the formation of stable limit cycles and how different initial conditions converge to these cycles, validating the theoretical predictions.
        </li>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Results</h3>
        <li>Successful Communication Strategy: The communications system I developed allows for consistent data transmission between Mars and Earth, even under challenging conditions such as solar conjunction. The DSN stations in Australia, Spain, and California were leveraged to ensure continuous coverage, maximizing data transfer opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>Robust Link Performance: The link budget analysis confirmed that our communication system could meet or exceed the required signal-to-noise ratios, ensuring clear communication even during critical mission phases. This robustness is vital for both the scientific and navigational aspects of the mission.
