        <h2 class="mb-5">Application of Linear Consensus Protocol to Space Debris Deorbiting</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Overview</h3>

          This project focuses on addressing the growing problem of space debris in Earth’s orbit. The solution involves using a Linear Consensus Protocol (LCP) to optimize the process of deorbiting debris, particularly in Medium and High Earth Orbits (MEO and HEO). Unlike traditional methods that target debris clusters, this approach dynamically assigns agents to debris, aiming to minimize fuel consumption while ensuring all detected debris is safely deorbited.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-0">My Contributions</h3>
        <li><b>Orbit Propagation:</b> I developed the code to simulate the orbits of debris and agents in both Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems, laying the foundation for the deorbiting process.
        </li>
        <li><b>Algorithm Implementation:</b> I implemented and tested the LCP in Cartesian coordinates, which allowed agents to effectively target and deorbit debris. Additionally, I attempted to adapt this protocol to spherical coordinates, though further refinement is needed.
        </li>
        <li><b>Analysis and Documentation:</b> I analyzed the challenges and findings of the project, documenting the limitations of using LCP for orbital debris and suggesting potential improvements.
        </li>
        
        <p>This project was first written in Python, and I translated it to Julia for more efficient computing
          as the simulations can get quite slow as the number of objects increase.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Results</h3>
        <li>Successfully demonstrated the LCP in Cartesian coordinates, where agents could deorbit debris effectively in a simulated 3D environment.
        </li>
        <li>Identified the limitations of LCP in spherical coordinates, where nonlinear orbital dynamics require a more advanced consensus method.
        </li>
        <li>Proposed future directions for improving the deorbiting algorithm, including exploring nonlinear consensus methods and optimizing trajectories for multiple debris.

        <h2 class="mb-5">Limit Cycles in Predator-Prey Systems</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Overview</h3>
        <p>This project is a literature review focused on the dynamic behavior of predator-prey systems, specifically exploring the existence and stability of limit cycles—a phenomenon where predator and prey populations oscillate in a predictable pattern over time. The review delves into the mathematical underpinnings of these cycles by analyzing seminal works by Robert M. May and Michael E. Gilpin. By studying these systems through the lens of nonlinear differential equations and concepts like Hopf bifurcations, this project seeks to enhance our understanding of how predator-prey populations can coexist in a stable, yet dynamic equilibrium.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-0">My Contributions</h3>
        <li><b>Mathematical Analysis:</b> I conducted a thorough mathematical analysis of predator-prey models, starting with the linearization of the system at its equilibrium points. This involved calculating eigenvalues to determine the stability of these points and exploring how small perturbations could lead to large-scale population oscillations, known as limit cycles.
        </li>  
        <li><b>Nondimensionalization:</b> To simplify the complex system and make the analysis more generalizable, I nondimensionalized the equations governing predator-prey interactions. This step reduced the number of parameters and highlighted the key factors influencing system behavior, making it easier to study the effects of various parameters on population dynamics.
        </li>
        <li><b>Simulation and Visualization:</b> I reproduced the results from the literature through simulations, generating plots that demonstrate how the predator-prey system evolves over time. These visualizations include phase plots that show the formation of stable limit cycles and how different initial conditions converge to these cycles, validating the theoretical predictions.
        </li>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Results</h3>
        <li><b>Stability of Limit Cycles:</b> The analysis confirmed that predator-prey systems can exhibit stable limit cycles, where the populations oscillate indefinitely in a predictable pattern. These cycles are stable even when the system is perturbed, as trajectories tend to converge to the limit cycle over time.
        </li>
        <li><b>Impact of Parameter Variation:</b> By varying key parameters, particularly around the Hopf bifurcation point, the simulations demonstrated how the system transitions from a stable equilibrium to a limit cycle.
